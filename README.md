# IMPORTANT
Do NOT send feedback/reports to ChoiceOfGames if you run into an error or your game crashes while using cheats. Feedback/reports are intended to debug REAL issues with the game, not issues resulting from modified stats and cheating.

The following cheats allow you to modify a game's stats in ways the author likely did not intend, meaning it's very easy to break the game. If you do run into an error, simply hit cancel, close out of the game, and restart.

# ChoiceScript_Stats_Modifier
1. Copy everything from one of the following Load.js options
2. Start the game
     - Make sure you've begun the game and are not on a side page (like the stats page)
3. Open the developer console -> (right click, inspect, console)
4. Paste Load.js code in the console and press enter
5. The cheats button should appear on the game screen
6. Clicking the button should open the Cheat window where you can now modify the game stats
7. After changing the desired stats, close the window, and click next to progress the game
     - Going to any other page, like the stats page, will undo stats modifications
