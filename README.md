# IMPORTANT
Do NOT send feedback to ChoiceOfGames if you run into an error or your game crashes while using cheats. These cheats allow you to modify a game's stats in ways that could very easily break the game. This feedback and reports are intended to debug real issues with the game, not issues resulting from modified stats and cheating.
