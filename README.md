# IMPORTANT
**Do _NOT_ send feedback/reports to ChoiceOfGames Support if you run into an error or your game crashes while using cheats.** Feedback/reports are intended to debug **REAL** issues with the game, not problems resulting from modified stats and cheating.

*The following cheats allow you to modify a game's stats in ways the author did not intend, meaning it's very easy to break the game. If you do run into an error, simply hit cancel, close out of the game, and restart.*

To avoid running into issues, I highly recommend viewing the game's code before modifying any stats - Especially if you plan on using *Load.js - Numbers, Booleans, and Strings*, as it's the most complex option (and currently the least tested).

**Known Issues:**
- An error related to the browser's memory/cache might occur. To fix it, close out of the game, then start it back up. You do not need to restart the game.

## ChoiceScript_Stats_Modifier
1. Copy everything from one of the following Load.js options
2. Start the game
     - Make sure you've begun the game and are not on a side page (like the stats page)
3. Open the developer console -> (right click, inspect, console)
4. Paste Load.js code in the console and press enter
5. The cheats button should appear on the game screen
6. Clicking the button should open the Cheat window where you can now modify the game stats
7. After changing the desired stats, close the window, and click next to progress the game
     - Going to any other page, like the stats page, will undo stats modifications
