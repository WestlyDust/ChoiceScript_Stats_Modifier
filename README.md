# IMPORTANT
**Do _NOT_ send feedback or reports to ChoiceOfGames Support if you run into an error or your game crashes while using cheats.** Feedback and reports are intended to debug **REAL** issues with the game, not problems resulting from modified stats and cheating.

*The following cheats allow you to modify a game's stats in ways the author did not intend, meaning it's very easy to break the game. If you do run into an error, simply hit cancel and restart the game from the beginning.*

To avoid running into issues, I highly recommend viewing the game's code before modifying any stats - especially if you plan on using *Load.js - Numbers, Booleans, and Strings*, as it's the most complex option.

**Possible Issues:**
- An error related to the browser's memory/cache might occur that can make the game lag and slow down. Use the Reload button or close out of the game if this happens. You do not need to restart the game progress - just remember to click next before reloading to save any changes you made to the stats.

1. Copy everything from one of the following Load.js options
2. Start the game
     - Make sure you've begun the game and are not on a side page (like the stats page)
3. Open the developer console -> (right click, inspect, console)
4. Paste Load.js code in the console and press enter
5. The cheats button should appear on the game screen
6. Clicking the button should open the Cheat window where you can now modify the game stats
7. After changing the desired stats, close the window, and click next to progress the game
     - Going to any other page, like the stats page, will undo stats modifications

### [Load.js - Numbers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WestlyDust/ChoiceScript_Stats_Modifier/Public/CheatNumbers/Load.js)
* Modify numerical stats
### [Load.js - Numbers and Booleans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WestlyDust/ChoiceScript_Stats_Modifier/Public/CheatNumbers%26Booleans/Load.js)
* Modify numerical and boolean (true/false) stats
### [Load.js - Numbers, Booleans, and Strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WestlyDust/ChoiceScript_Stats_Modifier/Public/CheatNumbers%26Booleans%26Strings/Load.js)
* Modify nearly all of the game's stats. This option might slow down the game, so use the Reload button after modifying and saving stat changes if any lag occurs.
